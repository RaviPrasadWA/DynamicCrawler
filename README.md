# MamtaScraper

I met this girl back at my hometown thought to name the scraper after her so MamtaScraper was born.

Basically we have used alot of reusable code and brought it as a visual solution for crawling, thanks to the Open Source Collaborators for there respective codes if any used.

MamtaScraper is inspired to extract data from websites via there selector.This particular package is a chrome extension that you could attach to your chrome browser and extract data
